            “I can’t believe you guys would even consider adding something like this! It
            goes against all of your company’s ethics! I thought Connekt was all about its
            users, and listening to the community. I can see now that that isn’t the case.
            As much as I’ve enjoyed working here up until this point, I don’t think I can
            continue to work for a company like this.”

            You completely refuse to implement the backdoor. While, you’re out of a job,
            at least you did the right thing. Surely the community will appreciate your
            efforts in keeping their interests in mind. Well, better start looking for
            that new job.
