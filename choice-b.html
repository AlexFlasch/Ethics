            “Unfortunately, since the government has requested this of us, we couldn’t easily
            refuse them. If we wanted to ignore it, it would likely take a large legal battle
            to settle, and Connekt just isn’t big enough to handle that right now. So, I’d
            like it if you just implemented it and hopefully we can figure something out later.”

            You decide to ask your boss if there’s any way the company could avoid putting the
            backdoor into the encryption. Putting a master lock on your encryption that you’ve
            worked so hard on feels like it would dirty your achievements. On top of all that,
            the thought of having potential security holes being used by the government,
            hackers, or maybe even Connekt itself doesn’t sit well with you.
