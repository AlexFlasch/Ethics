            “I’m not sure that I feel comfortable implementing the backdoor at all…”
            You trail off. “I really love working here, but putting something so easily
            abusable in our system really goes against my morals. I don’t think that I
            can do this.”
        </p>
        <p>
        	“I’m afraid that adding in that backdoor is critical to your job, so
            you’re going to have to do it, unless you’d rather look for a different
            job.” Your boss retorts, somewhat angrily.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“Well if that’s the case, I don’t think I can work here any longer. I’m
            sorry” you confess.

            You feel better knowing that you held to your beliefs, but you’re a bit
            sad you won’t get to work at your dream job anymore. Luckily there are
            at least a few other jobs you can think of that you’d love to work at.
            Better get searching!
        </p>

        <div class="separator" class="animated fadeInDown delay-3">

        </div>

        <p>
            By refusing to implement the backdoor, but asking first you've upheld
            section 1.4 of the ACM code of ethics "Be fair and take action not to
            discriminate" You've also broken section 2.6, "Honor contracts,
            agreements and assigned responsibilities" by refusing to do your
            assigned work. But you've upheld section 1.7 "Respect the privacy of
            others" by refusing to implement a backdoor for the company.
