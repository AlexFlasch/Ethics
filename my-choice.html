        <h3>My Choice</h3>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Personally, I would choose option B2. I would certainly not feel
            comfortable putting a backdoor into an encryption system,
            especially one that I’ve worked tirelessly on. I would try and
            work something out with my boss to see if there was an option to
            avoid implementing it, but if there were no other option I don’t
            think I would be able to continue working at such a place. I think
            it’s important for companies to stand by their ethics, whatever
            they may be. Especially when they have a large, dedicated userbase
            that could easily move to an alternative piece of software.
