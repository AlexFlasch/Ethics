        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <p class="big-letter">
            You’ve just landed your dream job working at Connekt.
            They’ve got a fairly well established communication platform,
            and you’re an avid user yourself. Connekt has been promising
            to make the next generation in communication software. They
            aim to please the customer and to come up with innovative new
            features that allow users to connect with each other in ways
            that haven’t been explored before. Connekt hasn’t been around
            for too long, but they’ve already got quite a good reputation
            for responding to user feedback and listening to what their
            community wants.

        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p class="big-letter">
            Walking into the office your first day it’s pretty easy to see
            that the office culture is extremely laid back. Everyone smiles
            and welcomes you to the team as you find your way to your desk.
            The guy the next desk over is named Jackson, and after holding
            a few-minute-long conversation with him, you find out that
            there’s even a beer fridge in the break room! Awesome!
            “Sounds like I’ll fit in just fine here” you decide. As you sit
            down at your desk your first day, you’re presented with some
            training. “This will probably take a few weeks to get through…”
            You think to yourself. And so you begin working.
        </p>
        <p>
            A week later you’ve gotten through a good portion of the training
            required. Unfortunately the work is rather mundane. Staying
            hopeful, you tell yourself it’ll be more interesting once you get
            to work on the actual product. Jackson likes to talk a lot and
            has been making it hard to get through all of your training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, after what seems like eons, all of your training is
            complete. Your department lead has looked it over and she says
            everything looks fantastic! She assigns you your first features
            to work on and you excitedly begin implementing them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s Jackson again. He wants to know how your work is going,
            but you know he’s just going to talk your ear off. Same as
            every other time he drops in. The boss walks by as you two
            are talking, and you try to look like you’re at least staying
            productive while Jackson continues to blabber. Jackson either
            doesn’t care, or doesn’t notice the boss walking by. Finally
            he leaves and you can get back to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finishing all of the features that were assigned to you,
            you get to watch as they go live. You’re excited to hear the users’
            opinions on them. You just hope that they keep up Connekt’s high
            standards and that the users enjoy them. Within a few days, though,
            you get some bug reports on your new features, so you set out on a
            bug hunting. In the middle of your bug-squashing session your boss
            walks in and tells you he’s got a new feature for you to work on.
            “It’s a doozy” she says. She asks you to implement platform-wide
            encryption on all forms of data sent through Connekt and all of
            their services. You love the idea, and even though you know you’ve
            got a long road ahead of you, you’re excited to get encryption
            working, and so you start typing away madly at your keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another few weeks have passed and Jackson has since been “let go”
            from Connekt, and you can only assume it’s due to his lack of work
            ethic. He’s constantly going around chatting to all of the other
            developers, and you’re not sure you’ve even seen any commits from
            him in the last month or two. You’re a little sad to see him go,
            seeing as he’s the one that you’ve talked to most, but secretly
            you’re a bit relieved that you can be more productive and not
            have to worry too heavily about your boss walking by as Jackson
            is talking to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of putting some of the finishing touches on your
            encryption, your boss approaches you. “Hey! Great job so far with
            the encryption. I’ve been following it pretty closely since it’s
            a heavily requested feature from our users. Seeing as it’s almost
            done, I’d love to take you and a few of the other developers out
            to the bar to celebrate! Does tonight work for you?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sure! I’d love to meet you guys there!” You reply.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later that night, you meet up with your boss and all of your
            coworkers. As you sit down at the bar you order a rum and coke,
            your go-to drink. After a couple of drinks your boss pulls you aside.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Hey, so I wanted to talk to you about a feature that we’ve been
            asked to implement in the encryption.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Sure, what kinda feature are we implementing?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, the government has demanded we put a backdoor in our encryption
            so that they can track any potentially threatening users that might be
            using our systems.”
        </p>
    </div>

    <p class="question animated fadeIn delay-5">
        So, how do you reply?
    </p>

    <div class="buttons animated fadeIn delay-5">
        <button id="choice-a" class="animated hvr-grow">
            Agree, and implement the backdoor.
        </button>
        <button id="choice-b" class="animated hvr-grow">
            Ask if there’s any way to avoid the backdoor.
        </button>
        <button id="choice-c" class="animated hvr-grow">
            Refuse, and put in your two weeks.
        </button>
