        <p>
            You’ve just landed your dream job working at Connekt.
            They’ve got a fairly well established communication platform,
            and you’re an avid user yourself. Connekt has been promising
            to make the next generation in communication software. They
            aim to please the customer and to come up with innovative new
            features that allow users to connect with each other in ways
            that haven’t been explored before. Connekt hasn’t been around
            for too long, but they’ve already got quite a good reputation
            for responding to user feedback and listening to what their
            community wants.
