            You agree to implement the backdoor. You ponder the fact that it nearly defeats
            the purpose of the encryption in the first place, and on top of that, it seems
            to go against the company’s ethics of listening to their community. The backdoor
            surely wouldn’t go over well with its users and may even completely eliminate
            the userbase if word that Connekt has a backdoor gets out and the reaction is
            strong enough. However, you love your job, and you don’t want to risk meeting
            a similar fate to Jackson.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily though, the info about the backdoor being implemented is very unlikely
            to get out to the public and you’ll probably forget about the whole situation
            within a few months. Heck, maybe the community would find out and, while the
            reaction would be bad, it would blow over within a few weeks anyways.
