            “Alright. I’ll put the backdoor in, but I’d really prefer if we can find some
            way to not put it to use. I don’t particularly like the idea of a backdoor in
            our system, seeing as it can be used by others that it isn’t intended for.”
            You tell your boss.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Thanks so much! I’m sure Connekt can find a way to fight for its removal at
            some point down the line!”
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="separator" class="animated fadeInDown delay-3">

            <circle cx="25" cy="25" r="2.5" />

        <p class="big-letter">
            But somehow you doubt that Connekt will ever get to fighting the government on
            such a large issue being the small company it is. You even begin to wonder if
            the company intends to fight it at all. But you love your job, and a little
            bit of guilt is better than looking for another career, right?
        </p>

        <div class="separator" class="animated fadeInDown delay-3">
            <svg viewbox="0 0 100 50">
                <circle cx="25" cy="25" r="2.5" />
                <circle cx="50" cy="25" r="2.5" />

        <p>
            As stated previously, by asking your boss about your options first, you honored
            section 1.4 of the ACM code. By implementing the backdoor, you've upheld section
            2.6 of the ACM Code of Ethics: "Honor contracts, agreements, and assigned
            responsibilities", but goes against section 1.7 "Respect the privacy of others".
            While you're being a good employee by following orders, you allow another
            company to invade users' privacy.
